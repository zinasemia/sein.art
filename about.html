                    With <strong>SEIN.</strong> we want to gather perspectives that are not shown often enough in the
                    art
                    context. </p>
                <p>Our focus is different works from different young artists all together in an exhibition
                    in <strong>Roskilde</strong> where we want to get deeper into the forms of our being (sein) in a
                    world
                    with a strong patriarchal system. </p>

                <p>Together we can show the inequality and discrimination that
                    FLINTA*(feminist,lesbian,inter,non-binary,trans,asexual.*) experience in various facets & make clear
                    that we will not take that anymore.</p>

                <p>Let’s be loud, emotional, sad, happy and angry all together and take our first steps in a
                    direction to a state of mind where everyone is being seen and heard for who and what they are.
                    We are all important for a collective and individual being <strong>|SEIN.</strong></p>

            <p>++“Sein” as a German possessive pronoun, meaning as much as “his” ++“Sein” as in being, translated with
                the English “to be” but with a deep meaning in that, our sense.++“Sein” in connection with other words
                is used to describe “taking part in sth” or “being there”.
