                            <p>With <strong>“Sein.“</strong> we gather necessary perspectives that are often neglected
                                in our society and the
                                artistic cosmos.</p>
                            <p>We are focussing on works from diverse young artists, all combined in our collective
                                exhibition
                                in <strong>Roskilde.</strong></p>
                            <p> There we urge to dive deep into the many aspects of our very being (sein) – in
                                a
                                world that is so roughly shaped by the everlasting patriarchal system
                                and internalized misogyny.</p>
                            <p>Let’s change that and
                                make it neverlasting!</p>

                            <p>Together we can show the inequality <strong>FLINTA*</strong> face in various facets –
                                and take our stand
                                for
                                the visibility of this discrimination to enact <strong>change.</strong></p>

                            <p>So let’s be fierce and emotional, harsh and sensitive, here and there, as we take our
                                first
                                steps in a direction to a state of mind that includes everyone, that sees everyone and
                                that
                                hears everyone for what they are. </p>

                            <p>It is up to all of us to encourage the acceptance and visibility of a collective and
                                individual
                                being. We want to <strong>create</strong>, you too?

                            With <strong>SEIN.</strong> we want to gather perspectives that are not shown often enough
                            in the
                            art
                            context. </p>
                        <p>Our focus is different works from different young artists all together in an exhibition
                            in <strong>Roskilde</strong> where we want to get deeper into the forms of our being (sein)
                            in a
                            world
                            with a strong patriarchal system. </p>

                        <p>Together we can show the inequality and discrimination that
                            FLINTA*(feminist,lesbian,inter,non-binary,trans,asexual.*) experience in various facets &
                            make clear
                            that we will not take that anymore.</p>

                        <p>Let’s be loud, emotional, sad, happy and angry all together and take our first steps in a
                            direction to a state of mind where everyone is being seen and heard for who and what they
                            are.
                            We are all important for a collective and individual being <strong>|SEIN.</strong></p>
